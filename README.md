## Vision Statement
Be a Ruby is a local non-profit organization that distributes items that they collect through donations. They currently have limited inventory tracking and stock notification, which makes it difficult to see what items need to be collected. Our mission is to create Ruby , a custom mobile application that will provide an intuitive interface for them to log and update their stock. To increase security and reduce errors when updating stock, the app will have administrator and site   roles that limit access to reading and writing to the stock log. Stock tracking with various access levels is used in almost every store; however, they’re for industrial settings where stock is marked with barcodes and usually has a high implementation cost, which isn’t practical for a small non-profit. As a stretch goal, Ruby would also include volunteering information for future events and links on how to donate.
