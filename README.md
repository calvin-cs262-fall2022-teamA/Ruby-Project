# Ruby Project

[Be a Ruby](https://www.bearuby.org/) is a local non-profit organization that distributes food and clothing donations to people in need in the Grand Rapids community. During their events, items such as take-out boxes and cups are stored in a trailer and removed by volunteers as they are needed. Currently, they have no system to track when these items are removed from the trailer, which makes it difficult to know when they are running out of a particular item. Our mission is to create Ruby, a custom mobile application, that will provide an intuitive interface for them to update and track their trailer inventories.

Until now, the founders of Be A Ruby have been unable to find an app with an easy interface to track their inventory. While other stock tracking tools are available and used in almost every store, they’re for industrial settings where stock is marked with barcodes. This usually has a high implementation cost, which isn’t practical for a small non-profit. Our app will provide Be A Ruby with a simple and customized stock tracking interface that works best for their specific needs. This will include an interface where volunteers can log items as they remove them from the trailer, and an administrator role that can add items and receive notifications if they're running out of any items. As a stretch goal, Ruby could be further customized to their organization by including a volunteer login with volunteering information for future events and links on how to donate.
